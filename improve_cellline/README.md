All proposed EPInformer models in our study are based on this core architecture. **EPInformer-promoter** masks all enhancer sequences with a zero vector and does not use any extra features; **EPInformer-PE** is a sequence-only model, using distance as the only additional feature. **EPInformer-PE-Activity** employs pre-trained residual convolution layers and takes promoter-enhancer sequences, distance, enhancer activity, promoter activity, and mRNA half-life features as inputs; **EPInformer-PE-Activity-HiC** includes the additional HiC contact feature compared to EPInformer-PE-Activity; MHA for multi-head attention. **EPInformer_v2** is used to incoporate gene embeddings from UKBioBERT. **EPInformer_v3** is used to incoporate silencer.
